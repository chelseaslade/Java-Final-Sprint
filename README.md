The E-Commerce Platform is a console-based application simulating an online marketplace. It offers a user-friendly menu system, allowing individuals to interact within a realistic market environment. Users can register under three distinct roles: buyer, seller, or administrator, each with tailored privileges. The role-based system ensures a secure and efficient marketplace experience. 

Key Features: 
•	User Registration & Authentication: Users can register with the platform, selecting their desired role. Securing passwords hashing (using BCrypt) ensures data protection.
•	Role-Based Control: The system employs a role-based access control, granting each user (buyer, seller, administrator) access to their relevant functionalities and features.
•	Product Management: 
  o	Buyers: Can browse the available products, search & view information.
  o	Sellers: Can list their products for sale, including details like name, price, quantities. Additionally, they can manage their listings by updating or deleting items. 
  o	Administrators: Can view all products in the system including the seller’s information.
  
User Management:
